# pico_contributors

[![MIT-Beerware license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT--Beerware-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Adds a contributors backend to Pico CMS, containing:
+ A file manager for .md content files inside /content/
+ An online Markdown editor with preview and some Markdown insertion options
+ An inline image manager with upload, download, preview, and storing of additional meta (title, description per image) options

## Install

1. Copy the "pico_contributors" folder into your Pico's "plugins" folder
2. Open the `contributors_config.php` file and insert your SHA256 hashed passwords and users :
``` PHP
    $pico_contributors_passwords['username2'] = '6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4';
```
3. Visit http://www.yoursite.com/contribute and login
4. That's it :)

## Dependencies

It may be obvious, but in order to PHP to manipulate images, you need the GD library.

## Usage

Contributors can:
+ create a new page named _timestamp_-_username_.md,
+ view, edit and delete all the pages they've created (all those with their username included in the filename),
+ upload, edit and delete images in their folder /content/images/_username_/
